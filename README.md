# smolder

Welcome to the Smolder! This will eventually be a knowledge base for regional burn events to organize and disseminate information, and for burners to interface with the community before, during, and after events.

I'm developing this to work on my skills and also to see if I can provide a friendly place to decommodify our events, to ensure we have a non-corporatist digital garden that respects our online privacy.

## Smolder Web

This is the web interface. Once it's developed to a sufficient point, I'll register a domain for it for easy access. I also intend for it to be easily self-hostable, in case anyone wants to :)

### Roadmap
* Friendly form-based workflow for event organizers to do stuff collaboratively
* Easy workflow for people to find information and acquire tickets
* Burn-based forums to allow for chatter before, during, and after events
* Individual burner profiles for anyone who wants to connect with the community
	* Also provides a way to easily exchange contact info during an event


## Smolder Mobile

This is the android app. I intend for it to have online and offline capabilities. 

### Roadmap
* Offline Features
	* Store paperless tickets offline on your phone
	* Pack-In/Pack-Out lists
* Online Features
	* Interface with Smolder Web to facilitate easy interactions
